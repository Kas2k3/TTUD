Description
Given a sequence of n integers a=a_1, . . ., a_n. A subsequence of a consists of contiguous elements of a (for example, a_i, a_(i+1), . . . ,a_j). The weight of a subsequence is defined to be the sum of its elements. A subsequence is called even-subsequnce if its weight is even. Find the even-subsequence of a having largest weight.

Input
Line 1: contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6)
Line 2: contains a_1, . . ., a_n (-10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6)

Output

The weight of the largest even-subsequence found, or write NOT_FOUND if no solution found.

Example
Input
4
1  2  -3  4

Output
4
