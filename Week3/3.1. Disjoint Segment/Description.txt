Description
Given a set of segments X = {(a_1, b_1), . . . , (a_n, b_n)} in which ai < bi are coordinates of the segment i on a line, i = 1, â€¦, n.  Find a subset of X having largest cardinality in which no two segments of the subset intersect

Input
Line 1: contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100000)
Line i+1 (i= 1,...,n): contains ai and bi (0 <= a_i <= b_i <= 1000000)

Output
Number of segments in the solution found.
